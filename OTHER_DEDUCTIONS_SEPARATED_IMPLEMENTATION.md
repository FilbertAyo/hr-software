# Other Deductions System - Separated Pages Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive **Other Deductions** system with **TWO SEPARATE PAGES** for managing deduction types and employee-specific deductions. The system supports dynamic document upload fields that appear only when the selected deduction type requires documentation, and includes a complete approval workflow.

## ✅ Key Updates

### 🔄 What Changed
The system was refactored from a single-page tabbed interface to **two separate pages** with individual navigation menu items for better organization and user experience.

### 📄 Two Separate Pages

#### 1. **Deduction Types Page** (`/other-deductions/types`)
- Manage categories of deductions (Internal, Discipline, Legal, etc.)
- Configure which types require document uploads
- Set active/inactive status
- Full CRUD operations

#### 2. **Employee Deductions Page** (`/other-deductions/employee-deductions`)
- Assign deductions to specific employees
- **Dynamic document upload field** - appears ONLY if the selected deduction type requires it
- Approval workflow (Pending → Approved/Rejected → Processed)
- View, approve, reject, edit, and delete deductions

## 🎨 Dynamic Document Upload Feature

### How It Works
The document upload field **automatically appears or disappears** based on the selected deduction type:

1. **User selects a deduction type** (e.g., "Discipline")
2. **System checks** if that type has `requires_document = true`
3. **If YES**: Document upload field slides down and becomes visible (and required)
4. **If NO**: Document upload field slides up and becomes hidden (and optional)

### JavaScript Implementation
```javascript
$('#other_deduction_type_id').on('change', function() {
    const selectedOption = $(this).find('option:selected');
    const requiresDoc = selectedOption.data('requires-doc');
    
    if (requiresDoc == '1') {
        $('#document_upload_section').slideDown();
        $('#document').attr('required', true);
    } else {
        $('#document_upload_section').slideUp();
        $('#document').attr('required', false);
    }
});
```

```

### Routes
```php
// Page routes
Route::get('/other-deductions/types', 'types')->name('other-deductions.types');
