# Employee Deductions Not Saving - Fix

## ❌ Problem
When creating a new employee and selecting deductions, they were **not being saved** to the `employee_deductions` table.

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `EmployeeController` has two methods for saving employee data:

1. **`store()` method** - Used when creating a NEW employee (one-page form)
2. **`updateSalaryDetails()` method** - Used when editing an EXISTING employee (step-by-step form)

### What Was Wrong:
The deduction saving logic was only in `updateSalaryDetails()` but **NOT in `store()`**!

```php
// ❌ store() method - Missing deduction logic
if (!empty($validatedData['earngroup_ids'])) {
    // Save earning groups ✓
}
// Deduction saving logic missing! ❌

// ✅ updateSalaryDetails() method - Had deduction logic
if (isset($validatedData['deduction_ids'])) {
    // Save deductions ✓
}
```

## ✅ Solution

Added the deduction saving logic to the `store()` method so it works for both:
- Creating new employees ✅
- Editing existing employees ✅

### Changes Made to `app/Http/Controllers/EmployeeController.php`

#### 1. Added Validation for Deductions in `store()` Method

```php
// Employee Deductions
'deduction_ids' => 'nullable|array',
'deduction_ids.*' => 'integer|exists:direct_deductions,id',
'deduction_member_numbers' => 'nullable|array',
'deduction_member_numbers.*' => 'nullable|string|max:255',
```

#### 2. Added Deduction Saving Logic in `store()` Method

```php
// Assign deductions to employee
if (!empty($validatedData['deduction_ids']) && is_array($validatedData['deduction_ids'])) {
    foreach ($validatedData['deduction_ids'] as $index => $deductionId) {
        if ($deductionId) {
            \App\Models\EmployeeDeduction::create([
                'employee_id' => $employee->id,
                'direct_deduction_id' => $deductionId,
                'member_number' => $validatedData['deduction_member_numbers'][$index] ?? null,
                'status' => 'active',
            ]);
        }
    }
}
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Creating New Employee (One-Page Form)

1. Fill in employee details
2. Add deductions via "Add Deduction" button
3. Enter member numbers if required
4. Click "Register Employee"
5. **Deductions are now saved!** ✅

### Editing Existing Employee (Step Form)

1. Edit employee → Step 2 (Salary)
2. Add/remove deductions
3. Click "Update Employee"
4. **Deductions are saved!** ✅

## 📊 What Gets Saved

For each deduction you add, the system saves:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `employee_id` | The employee ID | 9 |
| `direct_deduction_id` | The deduction type | 6 (NHIF) |
| `member_number` | Employee's member number | NHIF123456 |
| `status` | Active or inactive | active |

SELECT e.employee_name, dd.name as deduction, ed.member_number
