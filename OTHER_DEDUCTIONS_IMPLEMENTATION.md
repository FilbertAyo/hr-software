## 📊 Model Relationships

### OtherDeductionType
- `hasMany` → EmployeeOtherDeduction

### EmployeeOtherDeduction
- `belongsTo` → Employee

- `belongsTo` → User (approver)

### Employee (Updated)
- `hasMany` → EmployeeOtherDeduction (otherDeductions)
- New method: `approvedOtherDeductions()` for filtering

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Get All Deductions for an Employee
```php
$employee = Employee::find(1);
$deductions = $employee->otherDeductions;
```

### Get Only Approved Deductions
```php
$approvedDeductions = $employee->approvedOtherDeductions;
```

### Get Deduction Type with All Related Deductions
```php
$type = OtherDeductionType::with('employeeDeductions')->find(1);
```

### Calculate Total Pending Deductions for Employee
```php
$total = $employee->otherDeductions()
    ->where('status', 'pending')
    ->sum('amount');
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### File Storage
Documents are stored in `storage/app/public/deduction_documents/`

To ensure files are accessible, run:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

### Seeding
To seed initial deduction types:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=OtherDeductionTypesSeeder
```

## 📝 Notes

1. **Employee Table Schema**: The system uses `employee_status` (not `status`) and `employee_name` (not `first_name`/`last_name`) as per the database schema.

2. **Document Requirement**: When a deduction type is marked as requiring documents, admins can still create deductions without uploading - but the UI encourages uploads.

3. **Status Workflow**: 
   - Created → Pending
   - Pending → Approved/Rejected (by admin)
   - Approved → Processed (when applied to payroll)

4. **Deletion Protection**: Cannot delete a deduction type that has employee deductions assigned to it.

5. **File Cleanup**: When a deduction is deleted or document is replaced, old files are automatically removed from storage.
