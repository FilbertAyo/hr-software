## 💡 How It Works in Payroll

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Admin Creates Other Benefit
```
Go to: Allowances → Other Benefits → Details
Create:
  - Benefit Type: Performance Bonus
  - Amount: 100,000 TZS
  - Benefit Date: 2025-10-15
  - Taxable: Yes
  - Assign to: Selected Employees
```

#### 2. System Stores in Pivot Table
```
employee_other_benefit_details:
  employee_id: 5
  other_benefit_detail_id: 10
  status: active
```

#### 3. Process Payroll
```php
// System automatically:

// Gets earngroup allowances
$taxableAllowances = 200,000 TZS (from earngroups)

// Gets other benefits for this period
$taxableOtherBenefits = 100,000 TZS (Performance Bonus)

// Combines them
$taxableAllowances = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 TZS

// Uses in calculation
$grossSalary = $basicSalary + $taxableAllowances
```

#### 4. Stored in Payroll Record
```
payrolls table:
  taxable_allowances: 300,000 TZS (includes both)
  non_taxable_allowances: 80,000 TZS (includes both)
```

## 📊 Example Calculation

### Given:
- **Employee:** John Doe
- **Payroll Period:** Oct 1-31, 2025
- **Basic Salary:** 1,000,000 TZS
- **Pension:** 100,000 TZS

### Earngroups:
- Housing (Taxable): 200,000 TZS
- Transport (Non-taxable): 50,000 TZS

### Other Benefits (Oct 2025):
- Performance Bonus (Taxable): 100,000 TZS
- Lunch Allowance (Non-taxable): 30,000 TZS

### Calculation:
```
1. Combine Allowances:
   Taxable = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000 TZS ✅
   Non-Taxable = 50,000 + 30,000 = 80,000 TZS ✅

2. Gross Salary:
   = 1,000,000 + 300,000 = 1,300,000 TZS

3. Taxable Income:
   = 1,300,000 - 100,000 = 1,200,000 TZS

4. PAYE (15%):
   = 1,200,000 × 0.15 = 180,000 TZS

5. Total Deductions:
   = 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000 TZS

6. Net Salary:
   = 1,300,000 - 280,000 + 80,000 = 1,100,000 TZS ✅
```
