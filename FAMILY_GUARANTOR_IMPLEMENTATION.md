# Family and Guarantor Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the family and guarantor information saving functionality for employees in the HR system.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Structure
- **employee_families table**: Stores employee family member information
  - Fields: first_name, middle_name, last_name, relationship_id, mobile, home_mobile, email, date_of_birth, age, postal_address, district, ward, division, region, tribe, religion, attachment, is_dependant
  - Foreign key to employees table (cascade delete)
  - Foreign key to relations table for relationship types

- **employee_guarantors table**: Stores employee guarantor information
  - Fields: full_name, relationship, mobile, email, occupation, id_number, address, attachment
  - Foreign key to employees table (cascade delete)

### 2. Models Created/Updated
- **EmployeeFamily** (`app/Models/EmployeeFamily.php`): New model for family members
  - Includes relationship to Employee and Relation models
  - Has `getFullNameAttribute()` accessor for convenience
  
- **EmployeeGuarantor** (`app/Models/EmployeeGuarantor.php`): Updated model for guarantors
  - Updated fillable fields to match new structure
  
- **Employee** (`app/Models/Employee.php`): Updated with new relationships
  - Added `family()` relationship (hasMany)
  - Updated `guarantors()` relationship to use EmployeeGuarantor model

### 3. Controllers Created
- **EmployeeFamilyController** (`app/Http/Controllers/EmployeeFamilyController.php`)
  - `store()`: Add new family member with file upload support
  - `update()`: Update existing family member
  - `destroy()`: Delete family member and associated attachment
  
- **EmployeeGuarantorController** (`app/Http/Controllers/EmployeeGuarantorController.php`)
  - `store()`: Add new guarantor with file upload support
  - `update()`: Update existing guarantor
  - `destroy()`: Delete guarantor and associated attachment

### 4. Routes Added
```php
// Employee Family Routes
Route::post('/employees/{employee}/family', [EmployeeFamilyController::class, 'store'])
    ->name('employee.family.store');
Route::put('/employees/{employee}/family/{family}', [EmployeeFamilyController::class, 'update'])
    ->name('employee.family.update');
Route::delete('/employees/{employee}/family/{family}', [EmployeeFamilyController::class, 'destroy'])
    ->name('employee.family.destroy');

// Employee Guarantor Routes
Route::post('/employees/{employee}/guarantor', [EmployeeGuarantorController::class, 'store'])
    ->name('employee.guarantor.store');
Route::put('/employees/{employee}/guarantor/{guarantor}', [EmployeeGuarantorController::class, 'update'])
    ->name('employee.guarantor.update');
Route::delete('/employees/{employee}/guarantor/{guarantor}', [EmployeeGuarantorController::class, 'destroy'])
    ->name('employee.guarantor.destroy');
```

### 5. Views Updated
- **family.blade.php**: Fixed to handle both create and edit scenarios
  - Shows info message during employee creation
  - Displays family members table and modal form when editing existing employee
  - Added delete functionality with confirmation
  
- **gurantor.blade.php**: Fixed to handle both create and edit scenarios
  - Shows info message during employee creation
  - Displays guarantors table and modal form when editing existing employee
  - Added delete functionality with confirmation

### 6. Controller Updates
- **EmployeeController**:
  - `create()`: Added `$relationships` data for family form dropdown
  - `edit()`: Added eager loading of `family.relationship` and `guarantors`, plus `$relationships` data

## How It Works

### Adding Family Members
1. Navigate to employee edit page
2. Click "Add Family Member" button in the Family Relationships section
3. Fill in the modal form with family member details
4. Select relationship type from dropdown (populated from relations table)
5. Optionally upload attachment (PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG)
6. Check "Dependant" checkbox if applicable
7. Click "Save" to add the family member

### Adding Guarantors
1. Navigate to employee edit page
2. Click "Add Guarantor" button in the Guarantor Information section
3. Fill in the modal form with guarantor details
4. Select relationship type from dropdown
5. Optionally upload attachment (PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG)
6. Click "Save" to add the guarantor

### Deleting Records
- Both family members and guarantors can be deleted using the "Delete" button in their respective tables
- Deletion includes confirmation prompt
- Associated file attachments are automatically deleted from storage

## File Storage
- Family attachments stored in: `storage/app/public/family-attachments/`
- Guarantor attachments stored in: `storage/app/public/guarantor-attachments/`

## Important Notes
1. Family members and guarantors can only be added AFTER the employee is created (not during initial registration)
2. The create employee page shows an info message indicating these can be added later
3. All file uploads are validated (max 2MB, specific file types only)
4. Cascade delete is enabled - deleting an employee will automatically delete all associated family members and guarantors
5. The relationship field in family members references the `relations` table for standardized relationship types

## User Interface Flow

### Create Employee Page
- **Step 1**: Personal & Department Details
- **Step 2**: Payment & Salary Details

  - Modals are hidden during creation

### Edit Employee Page
- **Step 1**: Personal & Department Details
- **Step 2**: Payment & Salary Details
- **Step 3**: Family Relationships and Guarantor

## Database Migrations
Migrations have been successfully run:
- `2025_10_27_084826_create_employee_families_table`
- `2025_10_27_084903_create_employee_guarantors_table`

## Additional Notes
- Make sure the `storage/app/public` directory is linked using `php artisan storage:link`
- The `relations` table must have data for the relationship dropdown to work
- Family members use the `relations` table for standardized relationship types
- Guarantors use a simple string field for relationship (Friend, Colleague, Relative, Other)
