# Payroll Period Global Access Fix

## Problem
When creating a new payroll period and closing the previous one, the system continued to display the old/closed payroll period in the navigation and throughout the application. The current payroll period was not being updated globally after creation.

## Root Cause
1. The `PayPeriodController::store()` method created new periods but didn't update the session
2. The middleware and trait logic prioritized date-based queries over the 'draft' status
3. When a new period was created for a future month, it wouldn't be picked up as "current"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated PayPeriodController (app/Http/Controllers/PayPeriodController.php)
- Modified `store()` method to explicitly update the session with the newly created period
- Now immediately after creating a new period, it becomes the current one globally

```php
$newPeriod = PayrollPeriod::create([...]);
session(['current_payroll_period' => $newPeriod]);
```

### 2. Updated SetCompanyContext Middleware (app/Http/Middleware/SetCompanyContext.php)
- Implemented priority-based logic for determining current payroll period:
  - **Priority 1**: Period with 'draft' status (actively being worked on)
  - **Priority 2**: Period where current date falls within date range
  - **Priority 3**: Latest available period

### 3. Updated CompanyContext Trait (app/Traits/CompanyContext.php)
- Updated `getCurrentPayrollPeriod()` method to match the same priority logic
- Ensures consistency across the application

### 4. Updated CompanyController (app/Http/Controllers/CompanyController.php)
- Modified `switch()` method to use the same priority logic when switching companies
- Ensures correct period is loaded when changing companies

## How It Works Now

1. **Creating a New Period**:
   - Previous periods are closed (status changed to 'closed')
   - New period is created with 'draft' status
   - Session is immediately updated with the new period
   - All views and controllers now see the new period

2. **On Every Request** (via middleware):
   - System first looks for any period with 'draft' status
   - If found, uses it as current (regardless of date)
   - If no draft period, checks for period matching current date
   - If still none, uses the latest available period

3. **When Switching Companies**:
   - Same priority logic applies
   - Ensures correct period is loaded for the selected company

## Benefits
- ✅ New payroll periods are immediately accessible globally
- ✅ Draft periods are always prioritized (actively worked on)
- ✅ Consistent behavior across navigation, forms, and reports
- ✅ Works correctly even when creating future-dated periods
- ✅ Automatic fallback to date-based or latest period when needed

## Testing Recommendations
1. Create a new payroll period for the next month
2. Verify it appears immediately in the navigation
3. Check that it's selected in all payroll-related pages
4. Verify closed periods show correct status
5. Switch companies and verify correct period loads
6. Test with multiple draft periods (should use latest draft)
